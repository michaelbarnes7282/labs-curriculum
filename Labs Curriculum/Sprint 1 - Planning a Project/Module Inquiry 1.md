# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
    How should Parent/Child accounts be connected?
    How much of a code base are we working with?
2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
    Parents can create an account
    Parents can create sub accounts for each of their children
    Parents/Children can sign in to their personal dashboards using a PIN
3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    A child account regsiter page needs to be made
        signup form with username and pin entries
    POST request to server to create child account
    PUT request to server to link child and parent account
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
        Was able to get a good overview of what needs to be done. Could improve on digging more into detail.
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
    I would look to see if we had any source material to work with first. With this project some of the work is already done and my group spent a good amount of time going over       work thats already been done.
